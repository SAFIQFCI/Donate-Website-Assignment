                Each year the Adventist community comes together to mark World Refugee Day with a special Sabbath
                program and activities.
                This year World Refugee Sabbath is on June 18, 2022. It is a Sabbath set aside to open our hearts to
                refugees across the world; where we honor and celebrate their resilience while learning, praying, and
                acting to assist them in their need.
